This is a revised version of Rocky Script, a C# script for HS2.
Thanks for hjboy11, the original author of Rocky Script, and count360, whose work the part of UI is based on.
This is only a record for the code decompiled with dnspy, and you should re-compile it by yourself, because the version of the assembly reference is not suitable.
